StayFresh is an a app that makes managing food expiration dates a breeze, preventing any food waste and saving money. 
It allows users to track their grocery items, get timely reminders, and explore recipe ideas for soon-to-expire items. 
Its ideal for budget-conscious individuals, Stay Fresh guarantees savings while minimizing food waste. The app was inspired by our own 
experience struggling to make use of everything we buy and the current cost of living crisis. After some research we discovered that
the UK thows away 9.5 Million tons of food every year so we felt like this app would be a great way to help combat this.
